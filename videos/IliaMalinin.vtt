seat circle on the end but he goes down

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.910

[Music]

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.759
foreign

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.360
we're on the United States of America

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.360
area

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.820
so what about that

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.139
it was sensational

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.479
looking down at the schools here

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.759
he's sure to get a personal best with

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.259
that performance

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.220
just foot perfect on that Quad Axle 16

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.699
and a half points was his score for that

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:56.900
one jump pass

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.259
couldn't quite hold it together at the

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:05.100
end but I tell you what as he matures

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.620
can you imagine the sort of scores that

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.820
this guy is going to be posting

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.240
ethical score for that program even with

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.419
the mistakes in it

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.039
112.3 as it stands at the moment

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.539
he makes those chords look easy

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:29.639
remember the forces that are being

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.759
exerted on these fleets when they land

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.680
these quads it's something around seven

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.360
times your body weight

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.220
and you would never know it

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.440
so much spatial awareness all the way

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.180
through the program they're struggling a

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.560
little bit with that cordless at the end

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.960
he gets an under rotation for both parts

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.080
of that three jump combination but you

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.580
know these aren't tired legs that was

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.860
his first jump of the second half of the

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.720
program

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.300
think after all that he'd put into the

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.860
first half those four quads

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.479
his legs must have been screaming at him

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.520
and this was crazy at the end of the

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.400
program triple looks triple Axel is your

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.360
last jump pass

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.060
well he's lived up to the expectation

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.660
hasn't he

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.139
absolutely fantastic

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.819
but he's going to go into the lead but

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:43.099
by how much

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:48.180
194 29 and that is a new personal best

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.380
for Elia malanin the quad God gets

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.759
better and better

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:00.300
absolutely sensational

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.000
we've got three to go that's surely

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.440
going to get Elia on the podium
