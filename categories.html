		<h1>Freestyle</h1>
		<p>
		    Freestyle combines intricate footwork, spirals (sustained one-foot glides on a single edge), spins, and jumps. Footwork includes step maneuvers that are performed the length of the ice or in a circle and done in sequences demonstrating agility, dexterity, and speed. The skater changes position and moves in a straight line, circle, or serpentine patterns. Footwork also shows a skater's ability to interpret the music. At most amateur competitions the programs (a short and a long for intermediate level and above) must be performed to instrumental music, and skaters wear costumes made out of lightweight fabrics that allow for maximum flexibility and rigorous body movement. The costumes should be related to the music and express the musical themes the skaters are trying to relay.
		</p>
		<h2>Jumps</h2>

		</figure>
		<p>
			Jumps are probably the most recognized element of figure skating. All jumps share the same rotational position in the air, and all are landed on one foot, but they are distinguished by their takeoff positions. They fall into two main groups: edge jumps (salchow, loop, and axel) and toe jumps (toe loop, flip, and lutz), which are edge jumps assisted by a vault off the toe pick. The axel is distinct for two reasons: it is the only jump requiring the skater to lift off while skating forward, and it contains an extra half-revolution. (The double axel is actually two and a half revolutions.) Jumps are further classified as single, double, triple, or quadruple, depending on the number of rotations in the air. Jumps can also be done in combination; for example, a jump such as a triple axel can be immediately followed by another jump such as a triple toe loop.
		</p>
		<h2>Spins</h2>

		</figure>
		<p>
			Spins are generally performed on either the back outside or the back inside edge of the blade. A sit spin is done in sitting position, with the body supported by the leg that controls the spin as the free leg extends beside the bent skating leg. The layback spin, usually performed by women, requires an upright position; the skater arches her back and drops her head and shoulders toward the ice. The camel spin requires one leg to be extended parallel to the ice as the other leg controls the speed of the spin. A scratch spin is done in an upright position, and, depending on which foot the skater is spinning on, the spin can be done on either a back inside or a back outside edge, with the toe pick occasionally scratching the surface of the ice for balance. Skaters simultaneously pull in their arms and free leg, creating centrifugal force, which transforms the athlete into a blur. A combination spin combines several spins as the skater changes feet and position. Even though the spins last for many seconds, a skater recovers quickly from dizziness after years of practice.
		</p>
		<h1>Pairs Skating</h1>
		<p>
		    Pairs skating consists of a man and a woman performing jumps and spins in unison as well as such partnered elements as lifts, throw jumps, and death spirals. Good pairs skaters demonstrate symmetry and parallel flow across the ice. Unison elements are important in pairs skating. When the partners are not touching, they perform identical elements, including double and triple jumps, spins, and footwork. The elements are executed side by side and must be performed in symmetry at the same rate of speed.
		</p>
		<h2>Lifts</h2>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/lifts.jpeg" alt="lifting motion" width="300">
			<figcaption>The Male Player Lifted The Female Player</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Lifts are among the more spectacular elements of pairs skating. A basic lift is the overhead lift, in which the man raises his partner off the ice and balances her overhead with his arms fully extended as he moves across the ice. The star lift requires the man to raise his partner into the air by her hip while she forms a five-point “star” position with her extended legs, arms, and head. The twist lift requires both partners to skate backward as the man lifts his partner over his head and tosses her into the air. The airborne woman completes up to three rotations before being caught at the waist by the man and smoothly placed back on the ice. Another lift is the hydrant lift, in which the man tosses his partner over his head while skating backward; he then rotates one half-turn and catches his partner facing him. In the toe overhead lift the couple skates down the ice with the man facing forward and the woman backward. She taps her toe into the ice, assisting her takeoff, as the man lifts her into an overhead position before placing her back on the ice.
		</p>
		<h2>Spins and Throws</h2>

		</figure>
		<p>
			Other moves unique to pairs include the death spiral, in which the man pivots on the toe pick of one skate and the edge of another while the woman clasps his hand with an extended arm. She then leans horizontally over the ice on a single edge and drops her head toward the ice, with her body in an arched position. Throw jumps begin with the couple skating together at a high rate of speed. The man then helps the woman jump by using his arm to propel her into the air; the momentum carries her forward as she performs as many as three rotations (quads have recently been attempted) in the air and lands skating backward. The type of throw—salchow, toe loop, loop, or axel—like jumps in singles skating, is determined by which edge the female skater uses on takeoff.
		</p>
		<h1> Ice Dance</h1>
		<p>
		    Ice dance is similar to pairs in that two people skate together, but, unlike pairs, ice dancers do not do jumps and do only certain kinds of lifts. Instead, ice dancers focus on creating footwork and body movements that express dance on ice. To maintain the semblance of a dance rather than a pairs routine, limits are placed on the amount of time partners can be separated from each other and how far the distance can be between them. Unless the team is changing positions or performing a regulation lift, partners should be together in dance position. A requirement for the original dance is that one of the skates must be on the ice throughout the routine, and in the free dance both dancers must keep one skate on the ice at all times, except during lifts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ice dancing does not allow the introduction of such singles elements as jumps and intricate spins or such pairs moves as overhead lifts and throw jumps because they are thought to be inconsistent with the character of dance. Dance lifts, often done in the free dance, are legal, but moves that take the woman over the man's shoulder are not allowed. Dancers instead perform moves low to the ice, such as pull-throughs (the man drawing the woman between his legs) and drapes (laying the woman over the man's knee with a skate on the ice), to show their dexterity. Another common lift is the hand-to-hand hold lift, where the man primarily uses his hands to lift his partner.

		<h1>Synchronized Team Skating</h1>
		<p>
		    Amazing! Synchronized team skating, also known as precision skating, is the newest and fastest-growing skating sport. It consists of a team of 8 or more skaters (in the United States) or 12 or more skaters (in Canada) who perform various movements, which are in unison with at least part of the team. The sport was created in 1956 by Richard Porter in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where the Hockettes were the first precision team in the United States.

		<p>
			The skating elements consist of formations in such configurations as a circle, line, block, and wheel. Spirals are allowed, but jumps of more than one revolution are not allowed. Lifts are also not permitted. Synchronized team skating contains levels similar to those found in other types of skating. There are also national and world championships.
